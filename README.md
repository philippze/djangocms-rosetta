# djangocms-rosetta

Add links to rosetta's translation interface in the Django CMS Toolbar.

## Requirements

- Django>=1.7
- django-cms>=3.1
- django-rosetta>=0.7

It might also work with elder versions, but I havn't tested this (yet).


## Installation

This module requires a working `django-cms` installation.

To install it two things are necessary:

1. Install with pip:  
   `pip install git+git://github.com/philippze/djangocms-rosetta.git@master`
2. Add `djancocms_rosetta` and `rosetta` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
